<!-- What did we do here? We used a React method that returns a new React Element (also known as a component) and assigns it to 
our App variable.

Note that there are three different arguments provided to the React.createElement method. First, we have a string that 
contains h1. This tells React which element we want to create, in this case it is an h1 html element. Next, we have empty 
curly braces where we will pass props. We do not need to worry about this for the time being, but we will learn more about 
them later. Lastly, we send in the children. This is what we want to place within our h1 opening and closing tags. This could 
be a list of many different children (elements), but for now we are just sending in a string.

After we define the App const, we call ReactDOM.render. We are telling React to display our App component within the HTML 
element that has an id of root.

We have just written our first React project. If you open your index.html, you should briefly see "First React page rendering..."
before seeing "Our First React page has rendered". Our browser will first show the html we have written.

Then, after the React scripts load, our browser executes the script that will call the method ReactDOM.render. This method will 
overwrite what we originally had in the div with id root with an h1 that contains "Our First React page has rendered". If you 
continue to refresh your page, you can see it quickly change. Congratulations! You have created your first React project. -->
